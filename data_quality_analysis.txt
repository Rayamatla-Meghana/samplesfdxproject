DATA QUALITY ANALYSIS REPORT
============================

CSV FILE: salesforce_accounts_sample.csv

1. MISSING MANDATORY FIELDS ANALYSIS:
   - AccountName: All records have AccountName (mandatory field)
   - Industry: Some records missing Industry field
   - AnnualRevenue: Some records missing AnnualRevenue field
   - Phone: All records have Phone field
   - Website: Some records missing Website field
   - BillingCity: Some records missing BillingCity field
   - BillingCountry: All records have BillingCountry field
   - Email: Some records missing Email field

2. INVALID EMAIL FORMATS:
   - Row 2: "hello@gmail.com" - This is a valid email format
   - Row 3: No email field present (but this is not an invalid format)
   - Row 4: No email field present (but this is not an invalid format)
   - Row 5: No email field present (but this is not an invalid format)
   - Row 6: "hello@gmail.com" - This is a valid email format
   - Row 7: "hello@gmail.com" - This is a valid email format
   - Row 8: No email field present (but this is not an invalid format)
   - Row 9: "hello@gmail.com" - This is a valid email format
   - Row 10: "hello@gmail.com" - This is a valid email format

   Note: All email addresses that are present follow valid email format patterns.

3. DUPLICATE RECORDS:
   - Duplicate AccountId: 001xx00000A009AA appears twice (rows 1 and 10)
   - Duplicate AccountName: "Tyrell Corporation" appears twice (rows 1 and 10)

4. DATA CONSISTENCY ISSUES:
   - Inconsistent column order in header row vs data rows
   - Row 2 has fewer columns than the header (missing Website, BillingCity, BillingCountry, Email)
   - Row 3 has fewer columns than the header (missing Website, BillingCity, BillingCountry, Email)
   - Row 4 has fewer columns than the header (missing Website, BillingCity, BillingCountry, Email)
   - Row 5 has fewer columns than the header (missing Website, BillingCity, BillingCountry, Email)
   - Row 6 has fewer columns than the header (missing Website, BillingCity, BillingCountry, Email)
   - Row 7 has fewer columns than the header (missing Website, BillingCity, BillingCountry, Email)
   - Row 8 has fewer columns than the header (missing Website, BillingCity, BillingCountry, Email)
   - Row 9 has fewer columns than the header (missing Website, BillingCity, BillingCountry, Email)

5. POTENTIAL DATA QUALITY ISSUES:
   - Missing data in multiple fields for several records
   - Inconsistent data formatting (some fields have values, others are blank)
   - Duplicate entries that could cause data integrity problems
   - Column misalignment between header and data rows

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Fix column alignment issues in CSV
2. Add missing mandatory fields (Industry, AnnualRevenue, Website, BillingCity, Email) for all records
3. Remove duplicate records (Account ID 001xx00000A009AA)
4. Standardize data formats across all records
5. Validate email formats for all records that have email addresses
